### Data wrangling refreshser

1.  starting from penguins, write a single piped sequence in which you only include penguins at dream and biscoe islands, remove the year and sex variables, add a new column body_mass_kg coverted from g to kg, rename the island variable to location.

```{r}

penguins_1 <- penguins %>% 
  filter(island %in% c("Dream","Biscoe")) %>% 
  dplyr::select(-year, -sex) %>% 
  mutate(body_mass_kg = body_mass_g / 1000) %>% 
  rename(location = island)


```
